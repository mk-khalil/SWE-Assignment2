# Reflection

This assignment provided valuable experience with test-driven development (TDD) and Selenium, essential practices for ensuring web application reliability and quality.

Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of TDD and its benefits. Writing tests prior to implementing features ensures the code is robust and can handle various scenarios. Although we didn't strictly follow TDD in this example, the principle still holds value.

Selenium allowed me to automate the testing process, interacting with the application as a user would. This experience highlighted the importance of automated testing in ensuring application functionality and reducing manual testing time.

Some challenges encountered during the implementation process included environment setup, dependency installation, and WebDriver configuration for Selenium. Overcoming these challenges helped me become more familiar with the tools and their requirements.

Moving forward, I plan to apply TDD and Selenium to future web development projects, ensuring reliable and thoroughly tested applications. Incorporating these practices will enable me to enhance the quality and reliability of my projects.
